//Approach
  - Looking at the question I knew that it was the digits of Pi after the decimal
  - So I first Installed erlang, learned how to get it work
  - The I found that Pi can be written as 4*(1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7.....)
  - To get the number of digits I wanted I took another variable N and multiplied it as 0.1*N
